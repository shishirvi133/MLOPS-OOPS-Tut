1.Class and Object (Example)
2.Class has data/attribute and function /methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > Attribute get called itself,methods are called manually
3.Why Python is called OOP?-- evrything in python is an object( data,structure,data type etc)
4.Advantages of OOPs concept 
   > you can create your own data type
   > code reusability
   > debugging
   > easy to collab 

5.End to End Project (Chatbook Class)
   >Function vs methods
   >magic method/dundermethod
   >self
   >You can create attribute outside class as well
   >Encapsulation
   >Getter and setter
   >static method
6. Inheritance
     >Inheritance code example
     >Why inheritance is needed? (code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
     >What gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private attributes, Non private methods
     >Constructor overloading & method overloading
     >Super keyword (can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)
     >Types of inheritance -
       1. Single Inheritance 
       2. Multilevel 
       3. Hierarchical 
       4. Multiple (Diamond Problem) 
       5. Hybrid
